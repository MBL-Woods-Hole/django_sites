  <H3>How to download a user filled submission form from VAMPS</H3>
  <ol>
  <li>
  Have the user create a submisson on VAMPS (<a href="http://vamps.mbl.edu/utils/submissions/project_submit.php" target="_blank">Project Submission</a>).
  </li>

  <li>
  After you log into <a href="http://vamps.mbl.edu" target="_blank">VAMPS</a>, 
  click on the link 
  "<a href="http://vamps.mbl.edu/utils/submissions/admin_submission.php" target="_blank">CSV File Download/Upload</a>".
  <p/>
  (If you go from VAMPS it will be on the 
  "<a href="http://vamps.mbl.edu/utils/submissions/admin_submission.php" target="_blank">Project Submission-ADMIN</a>" page.)

  </li>

  <li>
  Select the submission you want, e.g. <span class="emph">sgrim123456</span>, then click "go" and then "Download csv". 
  <p/>
  That will download the CSV file to your local machine.
  </li>

  <li>
  Modify the downloaded CSV, 
  save as a UNIX csv (Microsoft does not do this by default -- you may have to open the csv in TextWrangler and save as a UNIX csv).
  </li>

  <li>
  Then you can upload the csv below on this page to use it for Illumina processing.
  </li>
  </ol>
